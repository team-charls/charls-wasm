## [0.8.0 - 2026-01-31]

### Added

- Initial release, based on https://github.com/chafey/charls-js

### Changed

- Applied StandardJS code style throughout the entire codebase (src/*, test/*, all JavaScript files).
- Switched to ES6 module system.
- Updated WASM to v3.0.
- Replaced emscripten bind generated JS code with adapters that call the C API of CharLS.

### Fixed

- Enabled native WASM exceptions. This allows CharLS to correctly report errors to the calling JS code.
- Corrected JavaScript code examples in documentation to follow StandardJS conventions.
